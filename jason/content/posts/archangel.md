Hello everyone,

Today's writeup will be about [Archangel from TryHackMe.](https://tryhackme.com/room/archangel)

This is a tough CTF challenge involving LFI, Apache Log Poisoning, and editing system commands.

However, because it is so unique, it's a good learning experience.

You can view my [PDF of this writeup here.](/archangel.pdf)

Hope you guys enjoy and learn something.
