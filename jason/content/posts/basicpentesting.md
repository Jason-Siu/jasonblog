Hello everyone!

This is my first official writeup, I wanted to make it as similar to a real penetration test providing documentation in sections. Hope you enjoy reading.

This writeup comes from a CTF called [Basic Pentesting by ashu.](https://tryhackme.com/r/room/basicpentestingjt)

You can [view the PDF writeup here.](/basicpentest.pdf)

I will make a video on this soon. Enjoy
