Hello everyone!

This is my presentation from CSG Firetalks about my experience penetration testing into a web app called "Sesame".

CSG officers and students there really enjoyed this presentation and I hope you will too.

This was my first real break into penetration testing and I learned a lot of things from communicating bugs, to actual penetration testing.

Have a great rest of the day, and I hope you learned something
