Hello!

Once again, today we have another CTF writeup, yet again.

Today's CTF will be [Chillhack from TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/room/chillhack), but despite the title, it's anything but chill.

It involves the use of multiple techniques, such as reverse shell, remote code execution bypassing, steganography, horizonal escalation, code analysis and more. It's pretty involved.

You can read [my PDF writeup here.](/chillhack.pdf)

Thanks for reading,
-- Jason
